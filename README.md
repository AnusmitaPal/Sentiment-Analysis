# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique used to
extract subjective information from textual data, gauging the
sentiment or opinion expressed within. In the realm of ecommerce, making predictions based on the customerâ€™s sentiments is crucial for business growth, customer satisfaction, tailoring marketing strategies, and optimizing product offerings.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) , has emerged as a promising tool for sentiment analysis due to its ability to capture long-term 
dependencies in sequential data.

Lstm: 
LSTMs are a kind of neural network related to regular
recurrent neural networks, but they use memory cells that
assist the network in keeping track of information over long
periods as has been described in the works of  One key
feature is associated with every memory cell: it keeps an
internal state whose value may go on for many steps without
changing. Thus, this stability ensures that during learning,
gradients do not vanish or explode, as it would help a network
handle more easily long-term dependencies in the data. The
weights in RNNs constitute long-term memory. During training, the weights themselves change slowly toward the general
encoding of data comprehension
